  <p1>> Performances, Arrangements, and Blurbs About Music</p1>

<p style="border-bottom: solid; padding-bottom: 18px;">
  I started making music when I was fairly young. I sang on my own for most of my
  childhood, before I began to sing with formal choirs, competition choirs, and honor choirs.
  Once I got to college, I discovered my love of a cappella music. I joined a group called "Exit 69,"
  named after the far less musical and fun exit that you take to get to Carleton from
  the highway. I've been with Exit 69 for two years now and though I absolutely love
  singing with the lovely people in our group, I enjoy arranging music for others
  to sing as well! The process of recreating music to accentuate someone's
  vocal talents and watching them shine is something I'll always enjoy doing and seeing.
</br></br></br>
  In regard to my music tastes, I like to believe I'm something of a music connoisseur.
  I listen to a little bit of everything, with a few artists and groups whose music
  I enjoy consistently.

<p2>> Exit 69 (Arrangements)</p2>
<p>
  "Where Were You In The Morning (A Cappella)" was originally performed by Shawn Mendes and was my first a cappella arrangement for Exit 69. Upon hearing the song initially, I really liked the feel of it and I had high hopes for its potential to sound great a cappella, 
  so I arranged it as so. The best decision I made about this song was my choice of the soloist, Daamir Johnson. His voice is perfect for the song and I was glad to have his smooth vocals to deliver a nice performance.

  "Habits", originally performed by Tove Lo, was my second arrangement for Exit and much better than my first
  arrangement. Writing the music for this piece, I was much better prepared, because I learned from my previous 
  arrangement that arranging music for vocalists is drastically different from how you'd arrange for instruments. 
  This might be my favorite of my arrangements that have already been performed, because of how fun it is and how 
  much the vocalist, Maddy Schilling, put into it from the vocals to the energy in her performance.

  "Hope" is the newest of my arrangements and was originally performed by the Chainsmokers and Winona Oak. This 
  arrangement is much intimate and "adult" musically. I chose to let this song stand on its own without a vocal 
  percussionist, opting instead for snaps that come and go to promote the up-close-and-personal feeling and idea of simplicity. 
  This piece really puts in the headspace of thinking about growing up and how that feels at different points in the process.
