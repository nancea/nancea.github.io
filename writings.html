  <p1>> Snippets of Essays and Other Papers I've Written That I'm Proud Of</p1>
</div>

<p2>1. <a href="Centering Liberation Theologies Around Poverty.pdf">Centering Liberation Theologies Around Poverty (page 1)</a></p2>
<p>> This essay is an analysis of points made by Ivan Petrella regarding what is a justifiable and somewhat more global
aspect of people's identities on which we can base discourse around Liberation Theologies. (Email me for the full text.)</p>
<p2>2. <a href="Historical Racism As It Applies to Liberation Theologies_ A Critique.pdf">Historical Racism As It Applies to Liberation Theologies: A Critique (pages 1 and 2)</a></p2>
<p>> In this text, you'll find a response to an earlier essay I wrote -- which you can find above --
in which I take a stance on points made by Ivan Petrella regarding his idea of a proper basis for Liberation Theologies. (Email me for the full text.)</p>
<p2>3. <a href="Paper 1_ Liberation Theologies.pdf">How Should We Understand Liberation Theologies? (pages 1 and 2)</a></p2>
<p>> How exactly should we understand liberation? What are Liberation Theologians saying about it? Through
my analysis of these questions and previous responses to them, I aim to revisit the question of what;s the "right" way to
think about Liberation Theology and apply it to the real world. (Email me for the full text.)</p>
<p2>4. <a href="Agency As Resistance Through Self-Governance And Implicit Power.pdf">Agency As Resistance Through Self-Governance And Implicit Power (page 1 and some of page 2)</a></p2>
<p>> Through this analysis of a day's reading in an upper-level religion course, I examine one woman's
agency and the way in which, because of its relationship with her, it's inherently implicit. (Email me for the full text.)</p>
